# Gesture-Recognition-and-CV

Independent Project â€“ Computer Vision and Gesture Recognition 

An exploration of edge computing and machine learning to develop a proof-of-concept product that can translate American Sign Language (ASL) using Computer
Vision (CV) in real-time. The project focuses on a use case in which a user walks into a coffee shop and their full interaction of placing an order is done using ASL. The Nvidia Jetson Edge computing platform is leveraged to create and train a model that can
be run on edge devices as a lightweight and portable solution.
